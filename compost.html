            Composting food is an environmentally friendly and efficient way to reduce food waste, while also improving soil health. Compost can involve organic materials like fruit and veggie scraps, coffee grounds and eggshells. Composting these items significantly reduces the amount of food that ends up in landfill while also creating valuable nutrients that enrich garden soil. Reducing the amount of food waste that goes to land fill helps lower greenhouse gas emissions and reduces the need for synthetic fertilisers.

             Some councils and regions provide green waste bins tube collected curbside but is not yet offered everywhere in the country. This is a great initiative that makes it easy for the public to limit the amount of food they put in the bin. This is a start but if this is not offered in your region starting your own compost is super easy and effective, you can ask local comunities the best way to do this or check out this FAQ's page to find out how to get started.
