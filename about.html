                    An issue that I have always noticed but wasnâ€™t often discussed is the amount of food waste created. As someone who has worked in several different cafes and restaurants the amount of food that is simply thrown out or discarded is absolutely shocking. Similarly I see plenty of food thrown out in households or in halls of residences and other commercial kitchens. I completed a project several years ago that skimmed the surface of this topic but did not offer any solutions so I knew I wanted to try and make a change with this website.
                    This website will walk you through everything you need to know in terms of food waste, Why is it an issue, What you can do to reduce it, recipes, tips and tricks, compost guide all to help save food that would otherwise end up in the bin.
                    I understand Kaitiakitanga as guardianship and protection of the natural land and resources. Any effort to protect or improve our natural world involved kaitiakitanga. In the context of Waste Less, Eat More it provides protection to the land by reducing waste and carbon emissions while looking after the food and resources that come from the land.
